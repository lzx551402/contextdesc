# ContextDesc implementation

![Framework](imgs/framework.png)

TensorFlow implementation of ContextDesc for CVPR'19 paper (oral) ["ContextDesc: Local Descriptor Augmentation with Cross-Modality Context"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04084), by Zixin Luo, Tianwei Shen, Lei Zhou, Jiahui Zhang, Yao Yao, Shiwei Li, Tian Fang and Long Quan.

This paper focuses on augmenting off-the-shelf local feature descriptors with two types of context: the visual context from high-level image representation, and geometric context from keypoint distribution. If you find this project useful, please cite:

## Update 4/13/2020

The training code is released in a separate project, [TFMatch](https://github.com/lzx551402/tfmatch), which also contains two related works ([GeoDesc](https://github.com/lzx551402/geodesc), CVPR'19 and [ASLFeat](https://github.com/lzx551402/ASLFeat), CVPR'20).

We release ContextDesc++_upright, which is trained with patch orientation fixed during training, i.e., without rotation perturbation. Such a model performs notably better when test images exhibit less rotation changes, or when keypoint orientation is used to normalize the input patches.

The effect of above modifications is summarized below. ``Recall`` on HPatches is reported.

| Settings       | ContextDesc++ | ContextDesc++_upright |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| upright: false |    74.54      |       72.20           |
| upright: true  |    77.16      |       78.76           |

## Requirements

Please use Python 3.6, install NumPy, OpenCV (3.4.2), OpenCV-Contrib (3.4.2) and TensorFlow (1.15.2). Refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for some other dependencies.

## Pre-trained model

We provide both the Protobuf files (for a quick start) and checkpoint files (for research purposes) for restoring the pre-trained weights, including

```
<contextdesc_model>
        ├── loc.pb (weights of the local feature model and matchability predictor)
        ├── aug.pb (weights of the augmentation model) 
        └── model.ckpt-* (checkpoint files for both the local feature model and agumentation model)
```

Several variants of ContextDesc as in the paper are provided for study.

# Training data

Training data is released in [GL3D](https://github.com/lzx551402/GL3D), and training code is available in [TFMatch](https://github.com/lzx551402/tfmatch).

## Example scripts

### 1. Test image matching

To get started, clone the repo and download the pretrained model (take `ContextDesc++` as an example):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lzx551402/contextdesc.git && \
mkdir ./contextdesc/pretrained && \
cd ./contextdesc/pretrained && \
wget https://research.altizure.com/data/contextdesc_models/contextdesc_pp.tar && \
tar -xvf contextdesc_pp.tar
```

then simply call:

```bash
cd ../contextdesc && python image_matching.py
```

The matching results from SIFT features (top), raw local features (middle) and augmented features (bottom) will be displayed. 

- To test the performance of a dense model, call the script with `--dense_desc`. 
- To use the TensorFlow checkpoint file for parameter restoring, call the script with `--type ckpt`.
- Type `python image_matching.py --h` to view more options and test on your own images.

### 2. Evaluation on HPatches Sequences 

First, download [HPSequences](http://icvl.ee.ic.ac.uk/vbalnt/hpatches/hpatches-sequences-release.tar.gz) (full image sequences of [HPatches](https://github.com/hpatches/hpatches-dataset) [[3]](#refs) and their corresponding homographies).

Second, download our CVPR intermediate results of keypoint locations and image patches for HPSequences ([Link](https://research.altizure.com/data/contextdesc_models/hseq_cvpr.tar)).

Unzip the above two downloads in the same folder, and you will find each .ppm image aside with a .pkl file.

Finally, to reproduce our CVPR results, configure the data root in `configs/hseq_eval.yaml`, and call call the evaluation script by:

```bash
cd /local/contextdesc && python hseq_eval.py --function hseq_eval --config configs/hseq_eval.yaml
```

For ContextDesc++, you will see Recall of 67.35/77.33 for i/v sequences, similar to the results reported in the original paper (67.53/77.20).

The updated results can be obtained by setting `suffix` to null in `configs/hseq_eval.yaml`. Due to some tweakings on the keypoint detector and patch extractor, it yields better results, i.e., 70.10/78.83 for i/v sequences.

To test Dense-ContextDesc, set `suffix` to null and `dense_desc` to true in `configs/hseq_eval.yaml`, and it will give 76.95/75.58 for i/v sequences. It shows that a dense prediction (with a global input normalization) is benefical for illumination change. However, since scale/rotation changes are handled in the intermediate feature maps, the perspective invariance is weakened.

### 3. Benchmark on image matching

ContextDesc, together with a learned matcher [[4]](#refs), won both the stereo and muti-view image matching tracks at [IMW2019](https://image-matching-workshop.github.io/). We provide the script that prepares the ContextDesc features and formats the submission files to this challenge.

To get started, follow the [challenge instructions](https://github.com/vcg-uvic/sfm_benchmark_release) to download the [test data](http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~kyi/files/2019/image-matching/imw2019-test.tar.gz).

Next, configure the data paths (`data_root`, `dump_root` and `submission_root`) in `configs/imw2019_eval.yaml`.

Then call the evaluation script by:

```bash
cd path/to/contextdesc && python evaluations.py --config configs/imw2019_eval.yaml
```

You may then compress and submit the results to the challenge website. 

### 4. Benchmark on visual localization

ContextDesc also achieved competitive results on [visual localization benchmark](https://www.visuallocalization.net/). Please download [Aachen Day-Night dataset](https://www.visuallocalization.net/datasets/) and follow the [evaluation instructions](https://github.com/tsattler/visuallocalizationbenchmark) to prepare the evaluation data.

Next, configure the data paths (`data_root` and `dump_root`) in `configs/aachen_eval.yaml`

Then extract the features by:

```bash
cd /local/contextdesc && python evaluations.py --config configs/aachen_eval.yaml
```

The extracted features will be saved alongside their corresponding images, e.g., the features for image `/local/Aachen_Day-Night/images/images_upright/db/1000.jpg` will be in the file `/local/Aachen_Day-Night/images/image_upright/db/1000.jpg.contextdesc10k_upright` (the method name here is `contextdesc10k_upright`).

Finally, refer to the [evaluation script](https://github.com/tsattler/visuallocalizationbenchmark) to generate and submit the results to the challenge website.
